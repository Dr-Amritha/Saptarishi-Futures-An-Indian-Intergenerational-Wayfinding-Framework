# Saptarishi Futures: An Indian Intergenerational Wayfinding Framework
An Intergenerational Future Study model contextualized within Indian mythology, folklore, and generational value systems. This fusion explores ancient cultural wisdom and modern anticipatory governance to imagine just, inclusive, and regenerative futures across generations.
1. Conceptual Premise
Drawing inspiration from:

Indian mythologies (Mahabharata, Ramayana, Puranas)

Folklores (Panchatantra, Jataka tales, Baul, Bhil and tribal narratives)

Generational frameworks (Ashrama Dharma, the Guru-Shishya Parampara)

Modern intergenerational justice principles

We develop a “Saptarishi Futures” framework: a 7-principle-based model (inspired by the 7 sages of Indian mythology) to navigate long-term societal wellbeing, drawing on moksha-based dharmic thinking for future generations.
